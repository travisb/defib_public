Petechiae: are small, flat, pinpoint-sized red or purple spots that appear on the skin or mucous membranes. They are caused by bleeding from tiny blood vessels called capillaries into the surrounding tissues. Petechiae are typically a result of bleeding disorders or certain medical conditions that affect blood clotting.
angere: Latin to choke or squeeze
angina: Angina (root: angere), also known as angina pectoris, is a type of chest pain or discomfort that occurs when the heart muscle does not receive an adequate supply of oxygen-rich blood. It is typically caused by a temporary reduction in blood flow to the heart.
asystole: Asystole, also known as "flatline," refers to the absence of any electrical activity in the heart. It is a state of cardiac arrest where there is no heartbeat and no effective pumping of blood.
atherosclerosis: build up calcium and cholesterol inside blood vessels 
croup: respiratory condition primarily affecting young children, typically between the ages of 6 months and 3 years. It is characterized by inflammation and swelling of the upper airways, including the larynx (voice box) and trachea (windpipe)
embolus: A blood clot or other substance in the circulatory system that travels to a blood vessel where it causes a blockage
ischemia: reduced blood supply to tissue or organs that can lead to necrosis (also infarction)
ischemia: refers to a condition where there is an inadequate blood supply to a particular organ or tissue in the body, resulting in reduced oxygen and nutrient delivery to that area. It occurs when there is a blockage or restriction in blood flow, often caused by narrowed or blocked blood vessels.
lumen (artery): The lumen of an artery refers to the central open space or cavity within the artery through which blood flows. It is the innermost part of the artery and provides a pathway for the passage of blood from the heart to various organs and tissues throughout the body.
myocardium: heart muscles 
pleural effusion: fluid outside the lungs in the pleural space
pleural space: The pleural space is the thin space located between the two layers of pleura, which are the membranes that line the lungs and the chest cavity.
pneumothorax: partial or complete accumulation of air in the pleural space
status asthmaticus: the airways become extremely narrowed, and inflammation persists despite treatment attempts
thromboembalisim: blood clot floating through the vessels -> AMI
zoology: the study of zoos
