### Anatomy and Physiology of the GI System

__***Liver:***__
========

  Assists in digestion by secreting bile -> digestion of fats, 
  filters toxic substances from digestion, creates glucose stores,
  makes some blood clot helping stuff

___Galbladder:___
==========

  Hollow pouch located beneath liver that stores bile

***Small Intestine:***
=================

  **3 components:**

    **Duodenum:** Digestive juices from pancreas and liver mix here 
    **Jejunum:** 
        - Plays a role in the absorption of digestive products
        - Large amount of surface area of SI and does most of the work
    **Ileum:** Absorbs previously unabsorbed nutrients and returns bile 
            to the liver to make **vitamin B12**,
            _used in making nerve and red blood cells_

***Pancreas:***
===========

  Secretes juice containing enzymes such as **amylase** that _help break down starches, fats, and proteins_.
  Also produces _bicarbonate_ and _insulin_ 

    - bicarbonate neutralizes the stomach acid in the duodenum.
    - Insulin helps regulate the levels of glucose in the bloodstream.

  The food that is _not broken down_ and used as nutrients -> colon | large intestine, as waste products.
  _Peristalsis_ moves the waste matter through the intestines.

***Spleen:***
========

  - _Located in the abdomen_ but has **no digestive system function**
  - Is part of the _lymphatic_ system,
  - plays a significant role vis. _red blood cells_ and the _immune system_,
  - assists in **filtration of blood**
  - Aids in the **production of red blood cells**
  - **blood reservoir**
  - **Produces antibodies** -> fight off disease and infection
