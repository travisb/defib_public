# Defib Academy EMT Education Program - Chapter 13-16 Study Guide

## Define the following terms:

  - Index of suspicion - ***STILL VERY UNCLEAR HOW TO COMMUNICATE THIS CONCEPT TO A 3RD GRADER***
  - dyspnea  - Cant breathe 
  - Stridor - Wheezing sound most commonly heard during inhalation but can
              also be heard during exhalation. Commonly associated with 
              - **croup:** Inflammation and swelling of the airway, typically 
                caused by viral infections, lead to the characteristic 
                "seal bark" cough and stridor.
              - **Epiglottis Inflammation** and swelling of the epiglottis, 
                often caused by a bacterial infection, can result in severe 
                stridor and difficulty breathing.
              - Anaphylaxis: Severe allergic reactions can cause swelling of 
                the throat and upper airway, leading to stridor and respiratory 
                distress.
  - Wheezes  - High pitched sounds that occurs during breathing (both 
              inhalation and exhalation).  Asthma, COPD, Bronchiolitis
              allergic reactions and resp. infections are common
              causes
  - Crackles (rales) - A lung sound often described as a series of pops
                      or crackling sounds. Can be classified as either 
                      fine or coarse crackles.
  - Rhonchi  - Low pitched rumbling sound that resembles snoring or rattling.
              Occurs when they are often heard during auscultation 
              (listening with a stethoscope) of the lungs. 
              Rhonchi result from the obstruction or narrowing of the larger 
              airways due to the presence of thick mucus or fluid. 
  - Aerobic metabolism - The metabolic in the presence of oxygen to generate 
                        energy for cellular activities.  **It is the primary
                        energy producing pathway in the human body** and 
                        and highly efficient in producing adenosine 
                        triphosphate **(ATP)** the molecule that 
                        serves as the universal energy currency of cells

  - Anaerobic metabolism - Anaerobic metabolism Creates lactic acid
  - Acidosis - An imbalance in the body's acid-base equilibrium, resulting
              in an excess of acide or a decrease in bicarbonaate 
              levels in the blood
                          
  - Alkalosis - the opposite of Acidosis
  - Virulence - the degreee or intensity of a pathogenicitiy of a mircroorganisim 
                such as a virus, bacteria or fungus
  - Shock - Life threatening condition in where there is an inadequate supply of
            oxygen and nutrients to the body's tissues and organs.  Can lead to 
            organ failure/disfunction
      
      **Symptoms of Shock Include:**

      - Pale or cool skin
      - Rapid, weak pulse
      - Low blood pressure
      - Rapid and shallow breathing
      - Altered mental status or confusion A&4o
      - Dizziness or fainting
      - Decreased urine output
      - Weakness or fatigue
      - Anxiety or restlessness
    
    **Treatment of Shock**
    ------------------

      **Note:** _Failure to do **any** of the following steps results in an 
      **automatic skills failure**_
      
      - Blanket
      - O2
      - Place PT in a supine position

    **Types of Shock:**

      - Hypovolemic Shock - A significant loss of blood or fluids. 
        Eg: **bleeding/dehydration/fluid loss** (see @travisb on montevena on sunday)
      - Cardiogenic Shock - Heart fails to pump effectively -> inadequate blood supply
        Eg. **heart attack (myocardial infraction), severe heart failure, arrthythmias**
      - Distributive Shock - Abnormal blood vessel dillation leading to poor circulation
        Eg: **septic, Anaphylactic, neruogenic (disruption of autonomic nervous system)**
      - Obstructive Shock - Occurs when there is a physical obstruction to blood following 
        Eg: **Pulmonary embolism (blockage of lungs blood vessels), cardiac tamponade
            (compression of the heart due to fluid accumulation in the pericardium[])

## Identify the location and function of the following anatomical structures:

  - Capillary Sphincters 

      **Function:** 
        
        Commonly used to refer to the dynamic constriction or relaxation 
        of the of the precaillary arterioles which regulate blood flor into 
        the capilaries. When they constrict they direct bloood to other
        parts of the body. Conversly, when they dilate they blood flows
        into the capillaries allowing for efficient exange of O2 and 
        nutrients and waste products 

      **Location:** 
        
        The precapillary arterioles are located at the entrance to the 
        capillary bed.  

## What are the signs, symptoms, common causes, and treatments associated with the following illnesses:

  ### __Tension pneumothorax__
    
   Air in the pleural space (space between lungs and chest walls)

  #### Causes/Symptoms
    
    - Truama (GSW, penetrating injury)
    - Blunt trauma, think car accident 
    - Sudden **sharp** chest pain ()
    - Difficulty breathing (dyspnea)
    - Cyanosis (if you dont know this means blue lips, etc it's time to drop out) 
    - Tracheal Deviation (the trachea moves away from affected side [why? air build up -> displaced things])

  ### Hyperventilation syndrome C. Pulmonary edema

  - Anaphylaxis 
  - Meningitis
  - Tuberculosis
  - Pleural effusion Cardiogenic shock
  - Neurogenic shock
  - Distributive shock
  - Obstructive shock

## Questions 

### What is the primary cause when children go into cardiac arrest?

  Respiratory failure seems like the most likely answer, **but decent argument for congenital conditions ?**

### What environmental conditions can exacerbate asthma?

**Off the top of my head** 

- environmental factors like temp, pollen, 

#### Likely correct answers 

- **Allergens:** (pollen, mold, mites, dander, roaches) "the tiny bits"
- **Tinier things:** smoke, smog and things like smog and smoke ~~~~~particulate matter~~~~~

## are we noticing a trend? ^^^^

- **Illness:** cold, flu, bronchitis, etc 

#### Question ???????

How are tiny bits and cold related vis. Asthma?

**Tiny bits:** 

- inflammatory response (makes sense "you, tiny bit, dont belong here, ima stop your forward motion, sorry not sorry (air <-> lungs)")
- increased sensitivity (TODO: chat gpt answer, dont understand underlying mechanism at all)

**Cold Air:**

- _Constricts_ bronchial tube, **bronchospasm**, _signs/symptoms:_ wheezing, coughing, shortness of breath

### What is the appropriate compression to ventilation ratio for one rescuer adult CPR? Two rescuer? One rescuer child and infant CPR? Two rescuer child and infant CPR?

#### One rescuer adult: 

30:2 

#### Two Rescuer Adult:

30:2

#### One Rescuer Infant:

15:2

#### Two Rescuer Infant:

15:2 

#### One Rescuer Child:

30:2

#### Two Rescuer Child:

30:2 


### What are risk factors for contracting Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus? (MRSA)

#### Off the top of my head:

- Being in a hospital 
- Staphylococcus, existing infection
- Riding BART 

#### Real answer:

**Being in a hospital:** 

- ICUs in particular 
- Invasive operations/procedures (surgery, catheters, dialysis)
- Over use of antibiotics 
- hanging out with hospital staphers (pun intended!)

**Community Factors:**

- close quarters (dorms, barracks, correctional facilities)
- sharing razors, towels, needles, sports equipment, 
- poor hygiene   

**Other Factors:**

- immuno-comprimised 
- chronic conditions 
- IV drug use 


### How do burns contribute to hypovolemic shock?

- fluid loss
- increased Capillary Permeability -> Inflammation -> fluids/electrolytes leaking out of tissue and vessels
- "third space fluid shift" -- TODO research if time allows 


### When should a patient be placed in recovery position?



### What causes gastric distension in the presence of CPR?

#### Off the cuff

over breathing for someone.  Eg, 120+ or full bags of air for each breath 

### What assessment priorities should be addressed in patients suspected of having a neurologic problem?

### What techniques should be used to relieve choking in a conscious adult? Child? Infant?

### What is the appropriate rate for chest compressions during CPR?

### What infectious illnesses does the DTaP vaccine protect against

### Compare and contrast ventilation versus respiration.
